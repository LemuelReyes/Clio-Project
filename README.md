# Clio Marketing Web Dev Project

## Solution

### Exercise 1

* Utilize flexbox by adding a parent div to flex the sections and the aside.
* Removed floats.

### Exercise 2

* Utilized flexbox to flex the substories into a column in the mobile breakpoints then back to rows going into tablet and desktop versions.

* Used RWD tools such as rems and percentages.

Mixins were put to work to nest css and utilize smart media query.

### Exercise 3

Exercise 3 proved most challenging. I have no experience coding e-mail templates from scratch so this
experience really helped me pick up valuable knowledge and experience.

I needed more time to work on this since I had to study on how to do it and "forget" the web development approach since
coding templates is unconventional and different from the normal development approach.

What was done:

* Pure HTML
* Code validated by W3C
* Tested through Litmus ( Outlook 2013, Gmail Chrome, iPhone 6S)
